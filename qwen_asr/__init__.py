qwen_asr: Qwen3-ASR package.

Top-level lazy imports: the inference module pulls in heavy deps (nagisa,
librosa, soundfile, sox, ...) that are not needed for the vLLM-backend
plugin path. Importing `qwen_asr` should therefore not eagerly import them;
they are only loaded when an inference symbol is actually accessed.
